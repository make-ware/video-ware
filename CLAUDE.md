## Architecture

This is a **Yarn v4 monorepo** (`yarn@4.12.0`) with four workspaces:

### Workspaces

- **`shared/`** (`@project/shared`) — Zod schemas, TypeScript types, PocketBase mutators, job definitions, storage backends. Built with `tsup` as dual CJS/ESM. **Must be built first** before other workspaces.
- **`webapp/`** (`@project/webapp`) — Next.js 16 frontend with React 19, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Uses App Router. Path alias: `@/*` → `src/*`.
- **`worker/`** (`@project/worker`) — NestJS background worker for media processing. Uses BullMQ (Redis-backed) with 4 queues: TRANSCODE, INTELLIGENCE, RENDER, LABELS. Integrates Google Cloud Video Intelligence API. Uses CommonJS modules with decorators enabled.
- **`pb/`** (`@project/pb`) — PocketBase database instance, migrations, and server-side hooks.

### Data Flow

```
shared (schemas, types, mutators)
  ↓
webapp: lib/pocketbase.ts → mutators/ → services/ → contexts/ → hooks/ → components/ → app/
worker: queue/ → task-*/processors → task-*/executors → task-*/normalizers → PocketBase updates
```

### Key Patterns

- **Mutators** (`shared/src/mutators/`): `BaseMutator<T, TInput>` base class wrapping PocketBase CRUD with Zod validation. Each collection has a dedicated mutator. Used by both webapp and worker.
- **Job definitions** (`shared/src/jobs/`): Typed contracts for transcode, render, labels, and recommendations jobs with step-level input/output types.
- **Storage** (`shared/src/storage/`): Interface-based `StorageBackend` with `LocalStorageBackend` and `S3StorageBackend` implementations, created via factory function. Server-only entrypoint (see below).
- **Browser/server split in shared**: `@project/shared` is consumed by the browser (Next.js client), the Next.js server, and the NestJS worker. Every entrypoint except `./storage` must stay browser-safe (no Node built-ins in its import graph) — enforced by `shared/src/__tests__/browser-safety.test.ts`. Server-only entrypoints map the `browser` condition in package.json `exports` to a throwing stub (`storage/browser-stub.ts`) so accidental client imports fail loudly at build/dev time. When adding a Node-only module to shared: give it its own entrypoint, add a browser-stub `exports` mapping, and list it under `SERVER_ONLY` in the browser-safety test. Pure helpers needed by the browser must live in isomorphic entrypoints, never in server-only ones.
- **Worker processors** (`worker/src/task-*/`): Each task type has processors (BullMQ handlers), executors (step implementations), normalizers (API response → DB schema), and services.
- **Environment validation** (`shared/src/env.ts`): All env vars validated with Zod via `validateEnv()` / `parseEnvOrThrow()`.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode across all workspaces
- ESLint flat config with `@typescript-eslint` strict rules
- Unused vars must be prefixed with `_` (error-level rule)
- No `console.log` in shared workspace
- Prettier: single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas (es5), 80 char width, 2-space indent
- Vitest for all testing (not Jest) — webapp uses `happy-dom` environment, worker and shared use `node`

## Logging

The worker uses the built-in **NestJS logger** (`new Logger(ClassName.name)`), not
`console.*`. Verbosity is controlled by `LOG_LEVEL`
(`verbose | debug | info | warn | error`), mapped onto NestJS levels in
[`worker/src/config/log-level.ts`](worker/src/config/log-level.ts) and applied once at
`NestFactory.create`. **`LOG_LEVEL` defaults to `debug`** — a plain local run shows the
full operational trace; set `LOG_LEVEL=info` (or higher) in production for a
signal-only stream.

Choosing a level when writing a log line — the guiding question is _"would an operator
want to see this at `info` in production?"_:

- **`error`** — an operation failed unrecoverably (task/step exhausted retries, an
  unhandled throw). Include the stack for `Error`s.
- **`warn`** — degraded-but-handled: a retryable step failure, a best-effort cleanup
  that failed, a tolerated missing/skipped condition.
- **`log`** (NestJS "info") — durable, coarse-grained signals worth keeping in
  production. Roughly **one line per task or per lifecycle event**, never per step or per
  file: service/config startup, "Task X started", "Task X completed successfully: N
  steps…", one-time migration/cleanup summaries.
- **`debug`** — routine per-step / per-job / per-file operational detail: individual
  step start/complete, per-child job-completed events, individual file
  upload/download/delete, per-directory cleanup/purge. This is the "ignore me unless I'm
  debugging" tier.
- **`verbose`** — extremely chatty tracing (e.g. "created temp directory").

Rule of thumb: if a message fires once per media file, per step, or per storage
operation, it's `debug`. Reserve `log` for whole-task and process-lifecycle milestones so
raising `LOG_LEVEL` to `info` leaves a clean, low-volume signal stream.

## Node/Engine Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.0.0
- Yarn 4.12.0 (managed via Corepack)
